        <li>1 cup fresh or frozen blueberries</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>

     <hr>

                                                                        <!-- Method -->

    <!-- This is for the sub-heading:"Instructions" -->
     <u><b><h2>Method</h2></b></u>

    <!-- This is for the content inside method.  -->
     <ol>
        <li><b> Prepare the Crust:</b> In a small bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter. Mix well until the crumbs are fully coated in butter. Spoon a small amount into the bottom of each serving cup or jar to form the crust layer.</li>
        <li><b>Make the Blueberry Compote:</b> In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine blueberries, sugar, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5-7 minutes, or until blueberries burst and the mixture is slightly thickened. Remove from heat and let cool.  </li>
        <li><b>Make the Cheesecake Layer:</b> Beat cream cheese, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract in a big mixing bowl until creamy and smooth. Whip heavy cream in another bowl until stiff peaks form. Gently fold whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture until combined.</li>
        <li><b>Assemble the Parfaits:</b> In each serving cup, make a layer of graham cracker crust, topped with a layer of cheesecake mixture, and spoon over a generous helping of blueberry compote. Repeat the layers until the cup is full.</li>
        <li><b>Chill:</b> Chill the parfaits in the refrigerator for a minimum of 2 hours, or until chilled and set.</li>
        <li><b>Serve:</b> Garnish with extra blueberries or a sprinkle of lemon zest for color and flavor.</li>
     </ol>
