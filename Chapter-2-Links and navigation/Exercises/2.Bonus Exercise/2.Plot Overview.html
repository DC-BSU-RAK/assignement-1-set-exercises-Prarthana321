        <p>"Ever After High: Way Too Wonderland" is an animated television special of 2015 that is the fifth installment of the "Ever After High" series, where the fairy tale journey of the new generation of fairy tale characters continues. This event takes place in a land of fantasy, secrecy, and danger as a group of students from Ever After High—students who are the offspring of famous fairy tale personalities—are called upon to travel into the fantastical, but vexed realm of Wonderland. Their mission is to retrieve the coveted Storybook of Legends, a magical object whose pages hold the fate of every fairy tale character.The stakes are high because the group must prevent the Queen of Hearts' destiny from being rewritten, something that can have devastating consequences for both Wonderland and Ever After High. When they enter Wonderland, they enter a world where logic is warped, rules are rewritten all the time, and nothing is what seems to be. Along the way, they meet familiar Wonderland figures like Madeline Hatter, the Mad Hatter's daughter, who is instrumental in leading them through the topsy-turvy confusion of this strange world.The tale centers on a few of the central students who embark on a journey to Wonderland, including the daughter of Queen of Hearts, a character named Madeline Hatter, and other popular characters such as Apple White and Raven Queen. They travel through the imaginary and dangerous worlds of Wonderland, face challenges, and attempt to prevent a magical disaster that has the power to destroy the entire Wonderland world. The overarching theme is about embracing one's destiny and treading the thin line of disorder and order. The characters must face their phobias, resolve their histories, and figure out who they are in the process.Storybook of Legends can still be found in Wonderland, so Raven Queen attempts to teleport over to claim it. Raven and the spell incidentally teletransport Apple White, Briar Beauty, Lizzie Hearts, Kitty Cheshire, and Madeline Hatter as well with them. The incident occurs before they arrive in Wonderland High by only a few days before Queen of Hearts' birthday. They here meet the Red and White Knights and must contend with obstacles by the Courtly Jester, who wishes to stop their mission. They need to understand the oddities of Wonderland and must deal with the Courtly Jester to set the proper destinies.</p>
